# Develop a web application with React and React Router


# Project description

This project is part of OpenClassrooms "DÃ©veloppeur d'application - JavaScript React" training.

The goal of this project is to create a responsive airbnb website clone.
Figma file was provided [here](https://www.figma.com/file/bAnXDNqRKCRRP8mY2gcb5p/UI-Design-Kasa-FR?node-id=4%3A1&t=1gZtUCpxpkFfX5zJ-0).

Main missions:

- Cutting into modular and reusable components.
- One component per file.
- Logical structure of the different files.
- Using state in components when needed.
- Event listener management.
- Route parameters are handled by React Router in the URL to retrieve information for each slot.
- There is one page per route.
- The 404 error page is returned for each non-existent route, or if a value present in the URL is not part of the data entered.
- The logic of the router is gathered in a single file.
